      Classification and Labeling of Chemicals: Comparison of Lists of the European 
      Union, Japan, Malaysia and New Zealand.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of 
      Chemicals (GHS) was developed to enhance chemical classification and hazard 
      communication systems worldwide. However, some of the elements such as building 
      blocks and data sources have the potential to cause "disharmony" to the GHS, 
      particularly in its classification results. It is known that some countries have 
      developed their own lists of classified chemicals in accordance with the GHS to 
      "standardize" the classification results within their respective countries. 
      However, the lists of classified chemicals may not be consistent among these 
      countries. METHOD: In this study, the lists of classified chemicals developed by 
      the European Union, Japan, Malaysia, and New Zealand were selected for comparison 
      of classification results for carcinogenicity, germ cell mutagenicity, and 
      reproductive toxicity. RESULTS: The findings show that only 54%, 66%, and 37% of 
      the classification results for each Carcinogen, Mutagen and Reproductive 
      toxicants hazard classes, respectively are the same among the selected countries. 
      This indicates a "moderate" level of consistency among the classified chemicals 
      lists. CONCLUSION: By using classification results for the carcinogenicity, germ 
      cell mutagenicity, and reproductive toxicity hazard classes, this study 
      demonstrates the "disharmony" in the classification results among the selected 
      countries. We believe that the findings of this study deserve the attention of 
      the relevant international bodies.
