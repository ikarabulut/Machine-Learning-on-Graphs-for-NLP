AB  - Strengthening of the health system is a safety imperative, especially in a crisis 
      as caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While there is a need for enhancing 
      the number and skill sets of the public health professionals, especially the 
      frontline workers, it will be prudent to use the digital health technologies, 
      including artificial intelligence, in enhancing the capacity of the healthcare 
      professional education and delivery. However, it has to be ensured that an 
      ethical and safe approach is adopted to develop and use digital health technology 
      and, ethically appropriate training is imparted, to enhance the capacity of the 
      human resources for health, leading to an overall health system strengthening.
