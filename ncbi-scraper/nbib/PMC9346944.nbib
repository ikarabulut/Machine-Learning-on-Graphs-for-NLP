TI  - Analyzing Safety Culture in Sri Lankan Industrial Chemical Laboratories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A laboratory where chemicals are handled can be considered a 
      hazardous environment, and hence, prudent practices should be strictly enforced. 
      If not, deadly accidents and incidents could occur due to a lack of safety 
      practices and poor safety culture. The purpose of this study is to analyze the 
      existing safety culture and propose potential recommendations to enhance the 
      level of safety education in the chemical laboratories in the Western Province of 
      Sri Lanka. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was administered among the laboratory 
      supervisors of the chemical laboratories in the Western Province of Sri Lanka in 
      2019. RESULTS: Even though 80 surveys were distributed among prospective 
      participants, only 46 surveys were submitted, which is 58% of the response rate. 
      Most of the individuals who participated in the survey were females below 35 
      years old, and approximately 96% of the participants had at least one year of 
      working experience in the same laboratory setting. The majority considered safety 
      as an important factor that requires further improvements with third-party safety 
      inspections; however, 54% of the respondents mentioned that those inspections 
      were conducted by the employees from their laboratory. CONCLUSION: From the 
      study, it has been discovered that employees have knowledge of safety culture to 
      a certain extent. A significant percentage (83%) of participants believed that 
      further safety measures are required for a safer laboratory. However, the study 
      revealed that the attitudes of some employees should be changed to have a better 
      safety culture. Hence the authors would like to suggest having annual training 
      sessions and well-formulated safety policies to improve the safety culture.
