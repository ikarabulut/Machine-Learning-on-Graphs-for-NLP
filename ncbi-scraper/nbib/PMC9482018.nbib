AB  - BACKGROUND: In the event of an industrial accident, the appropriate choice of 
      hospital is important for worker health and prognosis. This study investigates 
      whether the choice of hospital by the employer in the case of industrial 
      accidents affects the prognosis of injured employees. METHODS: Data from the 2018 
      Panel Study of Workers' Compensation Insurance in Korea were used in an unmatched 
      case-controlled study. The exposure variable is "hospital selection by an 
      employer," and the outcome variable is 'worker's disability." Odds ratios (ORs) 
      were estimated by modified Poisson regression and adjusted for age, gender, 
      underlying disease, injury severity, and workplace size and stratified by 
      industrial classification. The group at increased risk was analyzed and 
      stratified by age, gender, and area. RESULTS: In the construction industry, 
      hospital selection by the employer was significantly associated with increased 
      risk of disability (adjusted OR 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.32) 
      and severe disability (adjusted OR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.08-1.76) among the injured. 
      Female and younger workers not living in the Seoul capital area were more at risk 
      of disability and severe disability than those living in the Seoul capital area. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hospital selection by employers affects the prognosis of workers 
      injured in an industrial accident. For protecting workers' health and safety, 
      workplace emergency medical systems should be improved, and the selection of 
      appropriate hospitals to supply treatment should be reviewed.
