AB  - BACKGROUND: Occupational health and safety (OHS) is a significant interest of all 
      governments to prevent workplace hazards. Although appropriate legislation and 
      regulations are essentials for the protection of workers, they are solely not 
      enough. Application of them in practice should be secured by an efficient 
      inspection system. Fundamental components of an inspection system are inspectors 
      and their audit tasks. Maintaining the fair balanced task assignment among 
      inspectors strictly enhances the efficiency of the overall system. METHODS: This 
      study proposes a two-phased goal programming approach for OHS inspectors' task 
      assignments and presents a case study. RESULTS: The solution approach gives the 
      balanced assignment of inspectors to the workplaces in different cities of the 
      country in the planning period. The obtained schedule takes into account the 
      distances covered by the work places and the number of the workplaces' employees 
      to be audited and pays attention to the human factors by considering the 
      preferences of the inspectors. The comparisons between the obtained optimal 
      schedule and the implemented one that is produced manually show that the approach 
      not only maintains the technical requirements of the problem, but also provides 
      social and physical balance to the task assignment. CONCLUSION: Both the approach 
      and the application study are expected to offer fruitful inspirations in the area 
      of safety management and policy and they provide a good guide for social policy 
      and organizational aspects in the field of OHS inspectors' task assignment.
