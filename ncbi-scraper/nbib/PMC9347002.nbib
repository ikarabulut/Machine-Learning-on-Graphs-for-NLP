AB  - BACKGROUND: External-cause mortality is an important public health issue 
      worldwide. Considering its significance to workers' health and inequalities 
      across industries, we aimed to describe the state of external-cause mortality and 
      investigate its difference by industry in Republic of Korea based on data for 
      2018. METHODS: Data obtained from the Statistics Korea and Korean Employment 
      Information System were used. External causes of death were divided into three 
      categories (suicide, transport accident, and others), and death occurred during 
      employment period or within 90 days after unemployment was regarded as workers' 
      death. We calculated age- and sex-standardized mortalities per 100,000, 
      standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) compared to the general population and total 
      workers, and mortality rate ratios (RRs) across industries using information and 
      communication as a reference. Correlation analyses between income, education, and 
      mortality were conducted. RESULTS: Age- and sex-standardized external-cause 
      mortality per 100,000 in all workers was 29.4 (suicide: 16.2, transport accident: 
      6.6, others: 6.6). Compared to the general population, all external-cause and 
      suicide SMRs were significantly lower; however, there was no significant 
      difference in transport accidents. When compared to total workers, wholesale, 
      transportation, and business facilities management showed higher SMR for suicide, 
      and agriculture, forestry, and fishing, mining and quarrying, construction, 
      transportation and storage, and public administration and defense showed higher 
      SMR for transport accidents. A moderate to strong negative correlation was 
      observed between education level and mortality (both age- and sex-standardized 
      mortality rates and SMR compared to the general population). CONCLUSION: 
      Inequalities in external-cause mortalities from suicide, transport accidents, and 
      other causes were found. For reducing the differences, improved policies are 
      needed for industries with higher mortalities.
