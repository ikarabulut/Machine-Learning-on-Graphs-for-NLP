AB  - BACKGROUND: Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems are becoming more 
      widespread in organizations. Consequently, their effectiveness has become a core 
      topic for researchers. This paper evaluates the performance of the Occupational 
      Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001 specification in certified companies in 
      Iran. METHODS: The evaluation is based on a comparison of specific criteria and 
      indictors related to occupational health and safety management practices in three 
      certified and three noncertified companies. RESULTS: Findings indicate that the 
      performance of certified companies with respect to occupational health and safety 
      management practices is significantly better than that of noncertified companies. 
      CONCLUSION: Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001-certified 
      companies have a better level of occupational health and safety; this supports 
      the argument that Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems play an 
      important strategic role in health and safety in the workplace.
