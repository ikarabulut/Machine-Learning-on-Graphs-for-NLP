AB  - Hazardous area classification design is required to reduce the explosion risk in 
      process plants. Among the international design guidelines, only IEC 60079-10-1 
      proposes a new type of zone, namely zone 2 NE, to prevent explosion hazards. We 
      studied how to meet the zone 2 NE grade for a facility handling hydrogen gas, 
      which is considered as most dangerous among explosive gases. Zone 2 NE can be 
      achieved considering the grade of release, as well as the availability and 
      effectiveness of ventilation, which are factors indicative of the facility 
      condition and its surroundings. In the present study, we demonstrate that zone 2 
      NE can be achieved when the degree of ventilation is high by accessing 
      temperature, pressure, and size of leak hole. The release characteristic can be 
      derived by substituting the process condition of the hydrogen gas facility. The 
      equations are summarized considering relation of the operating temperature, 
      operating pressure, and size of leak hole. Through this relationship, the 
      non-hazardous condition can be realized from the perspective of inherent safety 
      by the combination of each parameter before the initial design of the hydrogen 
      gas facility.
