AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effect of increased job stress, caused by 
      musculoskeletal disease (MSD) among firefighters, on a firefighter's intention to 
      leave the profession, henceforth referred to as "turnover intention," and 
      verified the moderating effect of mindfulness on such a relationship. METHODS: A 
      survey involving a total of 549 Korean male firefighters as participants was 
      conducted herein, and the following results were obtained: the mediation effect 
      of the MSD to turnover intention through job stress was confirmed, and the 
      indirect effect of job stress was verified. RESULTS: We verified the moderated 
      mediation effect of mindfulness on the relation:MSD, job stress, and turnover 
      intention. The conditional indirect effect for middle and high levels of 
      mindfulness is significant. CONCLUSION: The result of this study is supported by 
      proofs of the relationship between a firefighter's MSD, job stress, and turnover 
      intention, and these case studies reveal the moderated mediation effect of 
      dispositional mindfulness.
