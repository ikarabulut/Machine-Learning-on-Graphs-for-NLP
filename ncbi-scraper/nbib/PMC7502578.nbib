TI  - Cancer Perceptions Among Smokeless Tobacco Users: A Qualitative Study of US 
      Firefighters.
PG  - 284-290
LID - 10.1016/j.shaw.2020.04.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates of smokeless tobacco (SLT) use among firefighters 
      are remarkably high and substantially higher than similar occupational groups and 
      the general U.S. population. The purpose of this study was to explore the 
      perspectives of fire service personnel regarding cancer and its associations with 
      tobacco and SLT use. METHODS: This descriptive study used a qualitative approach. 
      Key informant interviews were conducted in 39 career firefighters and fire 
      service administration from across the U.S. Discussion were recorded, transcribed 
      verbatim and transferred to NVivo software for narrative analysis. Topics 
      explored included cancer perceptions, attitudes and beliefs, and cultural factors 
      related to SLT use behaviors. Results: Major themes that emerged among fire 
      service personnel included concerns about cancer and its risk factors including 
      firefighting tasks, such as fire overhaul operations, and from their lifestyle 
      behaviors, such as alcohol and tobacco use. Firefighters also suggested a number 
      of reasons for their increased SLT use, such as fire department tobacco-free 
      policy and fire service culture. CONCLUSION: The current study provides a rich 
      foundation for future research, prevention, and intervention efforts for the fire 
      service and research communities regarding tobacco and SLT use and cancer risk. 
      Additional research on firefighters' cancer beliefs deserves future research in 
      order to improve messaging about the risks of cancer due to firefighting.
