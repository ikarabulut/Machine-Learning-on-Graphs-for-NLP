AB  - In the globalized field of safety, health, and well-being, the need to build 
      multi-stakeholder alliances to find solutions to complex challenges is growing. 
      This requires common ground for collaboration, as well as concepts and tools to 
      grasp and manage the areas of interest. Over recent years, Vision Zero has 
      awakened interest and it continues to evolve into many forms of approaches and 
      initiatives, which provide a strategic direction and practical tools for 
      supporting the development of safety, health, and well-being at work. 
      Consequently, there is a need to build a shared understanding of 'zero'. This 
      article reflects the potential of Vision Zero as a bridging concept and an 
      approach for building multi-stakeholder collaboration. Thus, we present a 
      multi-perspective framework of Vision Zero to support further dialoge and 
      collaboration in joint undertakings.
