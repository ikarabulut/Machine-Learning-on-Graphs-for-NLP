AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, the association of work and demographic 
      characteristics with different traffic offenses committed by food delivery riders 
      in Greece was examined. Previous research has identified various factors related 
      to risky driving however, there is a need for exploring the complex 
      interrelationship of work-related factors underlying risky driving behavior. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-items uestionnaire was used exploring delivery riders 
      demographic characteristics, terms of employment, issues of concern during work 
      and type of traffic offenses committed. In total, uestionnaires were analyzed 
      using logistic regression in order to identify characteristics independently 
      associated with serious traffic offenses, namely, red-light running and helmet 
      non-use. RESULTS: The analysis showed that: (i) typical health and safety 
      measures had no effect on serious traffic offenses, (ii) young age was related to 
      both offenses however (iii) different sets of work conditions were associated 
      with reports of red-light running (i.e. low work experience, use of personal 
      vehicle for work, and payment by hour) and helmet non-use respectively (i.e. 
      intense work pace, high tip income per day and low concern about vehicle 
      condition). CONCLUSION: The above findings provide evidence that serious traffic 
      offenses are manifestations of underlying conflict experienced by the riders 
      between safety and various performance criteria. Each one of the two offenses is 
      related to different rider profiles aiming to satisfy different goals, namely, 
      those mainly trying to maximize profit non-helmet users and those, mostly 
      inexperienced ones, trying to cope with work pressure red light runners. 
      Potential regulatory measures to alleviate risky practices are discussed.
