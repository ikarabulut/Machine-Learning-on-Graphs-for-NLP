AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the physical and mental health problems of waged workers 
      in Korea who had different classes of occupation. METHODS: We used data from the 
      Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2017) to examine 
      22,788 workers who were waged employees and categorized these workers into 5 
      occupational classes. RESULTS: "Unskilled manual workers" were more likely to be 
      older, less educated, have lower monthly income, and work fewer hours per week. 
      Among men and relative to "managers and professionals" (reference group), 
      "skilled manual workers" were more likely to have physician-diagnosed 
      osteoarthritis, "clerks" were less likely to report suicidal ideation, and 
      "unskilled manual workers" were more likely to report suicidal ideation. Among 
      women and relative to "managers and professionals" (reference group), "service 
      and sales workers" and "unskilled manual workers" were more likely to report 
      physician-diagnosed osteoarthritis, depressive feelings, and suicidal ideation. 
      However, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases did 
      not differ among the occupational classes for men and women. CONCLUSION: We 
      identified differences between men and women and among those in different 
      occupational classes regarding employment status, physical health, and mental 
      health. "Unskilled manual workers" of both genders were more likely to be older, 
      less educated, have less monthly income, work fewer hours per week, and have 
      suicidal ideation. Female "service and sales workers" were more likely to have 
      osteoarthritis, depressive feelings, and suicidal ideation.
