AB  - The occurrence of the shift work disorder (SWD) in health-care workers (HCWs) 
      employed in 24/7 hospital wards is a major concern through the world. In 
      accordance with literature, SWD is the most frequent work-related disturb in HCWs 
      working on shift schedules including night shift. In agreement with the 
      Luxembourg Declaration on workplace health promotion (WHP) in the European Union, 
      a WHP program has been developed in a large Hospital, involving both 
      individual-oriented and organizational-oriented measures, with the aim to prevent 
      the occurrence of SWD in nurses working on shifts including night shift. The 
      objective assessment of rotating shift work risk and the excessive sleepiness 
      were detected before and after the implementation of the WHP program, by using 
      the Rotating Shiftwork-questionnaire and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The 
      findings of this study showed the effectiveness of the implemented WHP program in 
      minimizing the impact of shift work on workers' health and in preventing the 
      misalignment between sleep-wake rhythm and shift working.
