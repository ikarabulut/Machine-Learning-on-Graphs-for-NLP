TI  - The "Warm Zone" Cases: Environmental Monitoring Immediately Outside the Fire 
      Incident Response Arena by Firefighters.

AB  - Hazardous work zones (i.e., hot, warm, and cold) are typically established by 
      emergency response teams during hazardous materials (HAZMAT) callsÂ but less 
      consistently for fire responses to segment personnel and response activities in 
      the immediate geographic area around the fire. Despite national guidelines, 
      studies have documented the inconsistent use of respiratory protective equipment 
      by firefighters at the fire scene. In this case-series report, we describe warm 
      zone gas levels using multigas detectors across five independent fire incident 
      responses all occurring in a large South Florida fire department. Multigas 
      detector data collected at each fire response indicate the presence of sustained 
      levels of volatile organic compounds in the "warm zone" of each fire event. These 
      cases suggest that firefighters should not only implement strategies for multigas 
      detector use within the warm zone but also include respiratory protection to 
      provide adequate safety from toxic exposures in the warm zone.
