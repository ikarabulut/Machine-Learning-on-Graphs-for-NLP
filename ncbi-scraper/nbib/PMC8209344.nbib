AB  - Singapore's construction sector employs more than 450,000 workers. During the 
      height of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore from April to June 2020, migrant 
      workers were disproportionately affected, including many working in the 
      construction sector. Shared accommodation and construction worksites emerged as 
      nexuses for COVID-19 transmission. Official government resources, including 
      COVID-19 epidemiological data, 43 advisories and 19 circulars by Singapore's 
      Ministries of Health and Manpower, were reviewed over 8 month period from March 
      to October 2020. From a peak COVID-19 incidence of 1,424.6/100,000 workers in May 
      2020, the incidence declined to 3.7/100,000 workers by October 2020. Multilevel 
      safe management measures were implemented to enable the phased reopening of 
      construction worksites from July 2020. Using the Swiss cheese risk management 
      model, the authors described the various governmental, industry, supervisory and 
      worker-specific interventions to prevent, detect and contain COVID-19 for safe 
      resumption of work for the construction sector.
