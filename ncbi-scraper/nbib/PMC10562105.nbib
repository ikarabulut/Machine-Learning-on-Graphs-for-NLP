AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to identify the working conditions and 
      health status of Vietnamese male migrant workers in Republic of Korea, in 
      comparison to the Korean general population. METHODS: We conducted our survey 
      through the Migrant People Center, and we received completed questionnaires from 
      87 male Vietnamese migrant workers. The questionnaire employed was identical to 
      those used in the Korean Working Conditions Survey and the 2020 Korea National 
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The collected data from the Vietnamese 
      migrant workers was then compared with the Korean reference population using 
      indirect age-standardization. RESULTS: Vietnamese male workers demonstrated a 
      higher prevalence of health problems including hearing problems (age-standardized 
      prevalence ratio (aSPR) 13.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.07-20.4), skin 
      problems (aSPR 13.49, 95% CI: 8.07-20.4), and low back pain (aSPR 8.40, 95% CI: 
      6.50-10.69). Elevated exposure to workplace hazards such as chemicals (aSPR 2.36, 
      95% CI: 1.51-3.51), organic solvents (aSPR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.44-3.28), handling of 
      heavy objects (aSPR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.24-2.21), and high temperatures (aSPR 1.96, 
      95% CI: 1.46-2.57) was observed among them. Additionally, they faced a higher 
      risk of no personal protective equipment (aSPR 2.53, 95% CI: 1.26-4.52) and a 
      greater prevalence of unmet medical needs (aSPR 7.14, 95% CI: 4.74-10.32). 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the elevated workplace hazards, health 
      problems, and unmet medical needs among Vietnamese male workers compared to the 
      Korean reference population. These findings underscores the urgency for enhanced 
      scrutiny over working conditions and protective equipment provision, coupled with 
      efforts to improve healthcare accessibility and worker education.
