TI  - Manual Handling in Aged Care: Impact of Environment-related Interventions on 
      Mobility.

AB  - The manual handling of people (MHP) is known to be associated with high incidence 
      of musculoskeletal disorders for aged care staff. Environment-related MHP 
      interventions, such as appropriate seated heights to aid sit-to-stand transfers, 
      can reduce staff injury while improving the patient's mobility. Promoting patient 
      mobility within the manual handling interaction is an endorsed MHP risk control 
      intervention strategy. This article provides a narrative review of the types of 
      MHP environmental controls that can improve mobility, as well as the extent to 
      which these environmental controls are considered in MHP risk management and 
      assessment tools. Although a range of possible environmental interventions exist, 
      current tools only consider these in a limited manner. Development of an 
      assessment tool that more comprehensively covers environmental strategies in MHP 
      risk management could help reduce staff injury and improve resident mobility 
      through auditing existing practicesÂ and guiding the design of new and refurbished 
      aged care facilities.
