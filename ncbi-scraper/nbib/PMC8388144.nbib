AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the lack of official COVID-19 statistics, various workplaces 
      and occupations have been at the center of COVID-19 outbreaks. We aimed to 
      compare legal measures and governance established for managing COVID-19 infection 
      risks at workplaces in nine Asia and Pacific countries and to recommend key 
      administrative measures. METHODS: We collected information on legal measures and 
      governance from both general citizens and workers regarding infection risks such 
      as COVID-19 from industrial hygiene professionals in nine countries (Indonesia, 
      India, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Republic of the Philippines, Republic of 
      Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: A 
      governmental body overseeing public health and welfare was in charge of 
      containing the spread and occurrence of infectious diseases under an infectious 
      disease control and prevention act or another special act, although the name of 
      the pertinent organizations and legislation vary among countries. Unlike in the 
      case of other traditional hazards, there have been no specific articles or 
      clauses describing the means of mitigating virus risk in the workplace that are 
      legally required of employers, making it difficult to define the responsibilities 
      of the employer. Each country maintains own legal systems regarding access to the 
      duration, administration, and financing of paid sick leave. Many workers may not 
      have access to paid sick leave even if it is legally guaranteed. CONCLUSION: 
      Specific legal measures to manage infectious disease risks, such as providing 
      proper personal protective equipment, education, engineering control measures, 
      and paid sick leave are recommended to be stipulated in Industrial safety and 
      health-related acts.
