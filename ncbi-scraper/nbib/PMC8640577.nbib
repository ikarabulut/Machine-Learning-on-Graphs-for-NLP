AB  - BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we estimated exposure prevalence and the number 
      of workers exposed to carcinogens by industry in Korea. The present study aimed 
      to evaluate the optimal exposure intensity indicators of airborne lead exposure 
      by comparing to blood lead measurements for the future development of the 
      carcinogen exposure intensity database. METHODS: Data concerning airborne lead 
      measurements and blood lead levels were collected from nationwide occupational 
      exposure databases, compiled between 2015 and 2016. Summary statistics, including 
      the arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM), and 95th percentile level (X95) 
      were calculated by industry both for airborne lead and blood lead measurements. 
      Since many measurements were below the limits of detection (LODs), the simple 
      replacement with half of the LOD and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods 
      were used for statistical analysis. For examining the optimal exposure indicator 
      of airborne lead exposure, blood lead levels were used as reference data for 
      subsequent rank correlation analyses. RESULTS: A total of 19,637 airborne lead 
      measurements and 32,848 blood lead measurements were used. In general, simple 
      replacement showed a higher correlation than MLE. The results showed that AM and 
      X95 using simple replacement could be used as optimal exposure intensity 
      indicators, while X95 showed better correlations than AM in industries with 20 or 
      more measurements. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that AM or X95 could be 
      potential candidates for exposure intensity indicators in the Korean carcinogen 
      exposure database. Especially, X95 is an optimal indicator where there are enough 
      measurements to compute X95 values.
