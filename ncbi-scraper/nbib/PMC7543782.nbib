AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in movement restrictions being instituted 
      globally and the cessation of work at many workplaces. However, during this 
      period, essential services such as healthcare, law enforcement, and critical 
      production and supply chain operations have been required to continue to 
      function. In Singapore, measures were put in place to protect the workers from 
      infection at the workplace, as well as to preserve the operational capability of 
      the essential service in a COVID-19 pandemic environment. This paper critically 
      analyses the measures that were implemented and discusses the extension to 
      broader general industry.
