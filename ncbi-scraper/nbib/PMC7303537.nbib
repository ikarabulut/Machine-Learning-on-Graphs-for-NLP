AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to illustrate the historical role of the 
      International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) congresses as an arena 
      where national and international occupational medicine can dialogue and as the 
      first example of scientific transferability of the research and prevention 
      results that have had such an impact on global public health. METHODS: We used 
      the ICOH Heritage Repository, in which ICOH congress proceedings (from the first 
      congress in Milan in 1906 to the last congress, held in Dublin in 2018), are 
      organised in an orderly way, updated and easily accessible according to open 
      access logic. RESULTS: We describe studies by three physicians who submitted 
      significant scientific work to ICOH congresses, one on the battle against 
      ancylostomiasis (Volante, 1906), the second (Quarelli, 1928) on carbon disulphide 
      poisoning, and the third (Viola, 1969) on the carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride 
      monomer. Priority is given to Italian cases, on account of the authors' obvious 
      familiarity with the issues. CONCLUSION: The visibility offered in ICOH 
      conferences and their published proceedings has boosted the international spread 
      of their findings, contributing to the scientific transferability of the research 
      results and influencing the development of policies and prevention interventions 
      that have had a great impact on global public health.
