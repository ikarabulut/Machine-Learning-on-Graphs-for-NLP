AB  - BACKGROUND: Work comfort studies have been extensively conducted, especially in 
      the underground and meteorological fields resulting in an avalanche of 
      recommendations for their evaluation. Nevertheless, no known or universally 
      accepted model for comprehensively assessing the thermal work condition of the 
      underground mine environment is currently available. Current literature presents 
      several methods and techniques, but none of these can expansively assess the 
      underground mine environment since most methods consider only one or a few 
      defined factors and neglect others. Some are specifically formulated for the 
      built and meteorological climates, thus making them unsuitable to accurately 
      assess the climatic conditions in underground development and production 
      workings. METHODS: This paper presents a series of sensitivity analyses to assess 
      the impact of environmental parameters and metabolic rate on the thermal comfort 
      for underground mining applications. An approach was developed in the form of a 
      "comfort model" which applied comfort parameters to extensively assess the 
      climatic conditions in the deep, hot, and humid underground mines. RESULTS: 
      Simulation analysis predicted comfort limits in the form of required sweat rate 
      and maximum skin wettedness. Tolerable worker exposure times to minimize thermal 
      strain due to dehydration are predicted. CONCLUSION: The analysis determined the 
      optimal air velocity for thermal comfort to be 1.5Â m/s. The results also 
      identified humidity to contribute more to deviations from thermal comfort than 
      other comfort parameters. It is expected that this new approach will 
      significantly help in managing heat stress issues in underground mines and thus 
      improve productivity, safety, and health.
