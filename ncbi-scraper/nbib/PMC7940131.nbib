AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in 
      employment status and new-onset depressive symptoms through a one-year follow-up 
      of permanent waged workers. METHODS: We analyzed the open-source data from the 
      Korea Welfare Panel Study. Using the 2017 data, we selected 2,314 permanent waged 
      workers aged 19 to 59 years without depressive symptoms as a base group. The 
      final analysis targeted 2,073 workers who were followed up in 2018. In 2018, 
      there were five categories of employment status for workers who were followed up: 
      permanent, precarious, unemployed, self-employed, and economically inactive. 
      Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between 
      employment status change and new-onset depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Adjusted 
      multiple logistic regression analysis showed that among male workers, workers who 
      went from permanent status to being unemployed (odds ratio: 4.50, 95% confidence 
      interval: 1.19 to 17.06) and from permanent status to being precarious workers 
      (odds ratio: 3.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.30 to 7.65) had significantly high 
      levels of new-onset depressive symptoms compared with those who retained their 
      permanent employment status. There were no significant increases in new-onset 
      depressive symptoms of male workers who went from permanent status to being 
      self-employed or economically inactive. On the other hand, no significant 
      differences were found among female workers. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that 
      the change of employment status to precarious workers or unemployment can cause 
      new-onset depressive symptoms in male permanent waged workers.
