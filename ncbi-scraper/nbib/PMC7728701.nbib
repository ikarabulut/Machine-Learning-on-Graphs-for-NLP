AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to examine the combined effects of 
      organizational climate (OC) with emotional labor (EL) on turnover intention in 
      Korean firefighters. METHODS: The data were obtained from the study Firefighters 
      Research: Enhancement of Safety and Health. A total of 4,860 firefighters whose 
      main duty was providing "emergency medical aid" were included. To examine the 
      effects of OC on the relationships between five subscales of EL and turnover 
      intention, four groups were created using various combinations of OC ("good" vs. 
      "bad") and EL ("normal" vs. "risk"): (1) "good" and "normal" (Group I), (2) "bad" 
      and "normal" (Group II), (3) "good" and "risk" (Group III), and (4) "bad" and 
      "risk" (Group IV). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to 
      estimate the risk of turnover intention for the combinations of OC and EL. 
      RESULTS: The results showed turnover intention was significantly higher in the 
      group with "bad" OC (17.7%) than in that with "good" OC (7.6%). Combined effects 
      of OC and EL on turnover intention were found in all five subscales with the 
      exception of Group I for emotional demands and regulation. Groups II, III, and IV 
      were more likely to experience risks of turnover intention than Group I (p for 
      trend <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A positive and cooperative OC plays a role in 
      decreasing the risk of turnover intention and in attenuating the negative effects 
      of EL on turnover intention in firefighters.
