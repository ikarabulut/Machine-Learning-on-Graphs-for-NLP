AB  - BACKGROUND: Firefighters are required to carry self-contained breathing apparatus 
      (SCBA), which increases the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. This study 
      assessed the newly recruited firefighters' internal forces and potential 
      musculoskeletal disorders when carrying SCBA. The effects of SCBA strap lengths 
      were also evaluated. METHODS: Kinematic parameters of twelve male subjects 
      running in a control condition with no SCBA equipped and three varying-strapped 
      SCBAs were measured using 3D inertial motion capture. Subsequently, motion data 
      and predicted ground reaction force were inputted for subject-specific 
      musculoskeletal modeling to estimate joint and muscle forces. RESULTS: The knee 
      was exposed to the highest internal force when carrying SCBA, followed by the 
      rectus femoris and hip, while the shoulder had the lowest force compared to the 
      no-SCBA condition. Our model also revealed that adjusting SCBA straps length was 
      an efficient strategy to influence the force that occurred at the lumbar spine, 
      hip, and knee regions. Grey relation analysis indicated that the deviation of the 
      center of mass, step length, and knee flexion-extension angle could be used as 
      the predictor of musculoskeletal disorders. CONCLUSION: The finding suggested 
      that the training of the newly recruits focuses on the coordinated movement of 
      muscle and joints in the lower limb. The strap lengths around 98-105 cm were also 
      recommended. The findings are expected to provide injury interventions to enhance 
      the occupational health and safety of the newly recruited firefighters.
