AB  - BACKGROUND: While the organizational factors that account for firefighters' 
      burnout have been extensively explored, the individual factors related to how 
      they regulate interpersonal conflicts and emotions remain to be investigated. 
      Previous research has demonstrated the association between emotional intelligence 
      and conflict management styles and burnout, but no study has looked at the 
      interrelationships among these factors in high-risk sectors. The present 
      exploratory study aimed to fill this research gap by investigating the 
      relationships between conflict management style, emotional intelligence and 
      burnout in a sample of firefighters. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted with 240 French firefighters. Measures comprised validated scales of 
      conflict management styles, emotional intelligence and burnout. RESULTS: Results 
      showed that the integrating conflict style reduced burnout. They also revealed 
      the effects of emotion regulation on burnout, whereby the awareness and 
      management of one's own emotions reduced burnout. Moreover, awareness of one's 
      own emotions moderated the relationship between integrating conflict resolution 
      style and burnout, whereby the effect of integrating style on reduced burnout was 
      higher when awareness of one's own emotions was high. CONCLUSION: These results 
      reveal that strategies used by firefighters to regulate their emotions in order 
      to meet the emotional demands specific to their job are important for reducing 
      the emotional exhaustion component of burnout. Training programs for conflict and 
      emotion management are needed to preserve the mental health of firefighters and 
      ensure the safety of interventions.
