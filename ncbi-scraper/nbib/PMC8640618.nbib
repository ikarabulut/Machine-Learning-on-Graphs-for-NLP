      Small to Medium Sized Enterprises.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Factors related to root causes can cause commonly occurring accidents 
      such as falls, slips, and jammed injuries. An important means of reducing the 
      frequency of occupational accidents in small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMSEs) 
      of South Korea is to perform intensity analysis of the root cause factors for 
      accident prevention in the cause and effect model like decision models, 
      epidemiological models, system models, human factors models, LCU (life change 
      unit) models, and the domino theory. Especially intensity analysis in a robot 
      system and smart technology as Industry 4.0 is very important in order to 
      minimize the occupational accidents and fatal accident because of the complexity 
      of accident factors. METHODS: We have developed the modern cause and effect model 
      that includes factors of root cause through statistical testing to minimize 
      commonly occurring accidents and fatal accidents in SMSEs of South Korea and 
      systematically proposed educational policies for accident prevention. RESULTS: As 
      a result, the consciousness factors among factors of root cause such as 
      unconsciousness, disregard, ignorance, recklessness, and misjudgment had strong 
      relationships with occupational accidents in South Korean SMSEs. CONCLUSION: We 
      conclude that the educational policies necessary for minimizing these 
      consciousness factors include continuous training procedures followed by periodic 
      hands-on experience, along with perceptual and cognitive education related to 
      occupational health and safety.
