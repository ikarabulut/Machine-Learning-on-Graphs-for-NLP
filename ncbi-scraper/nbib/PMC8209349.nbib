AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of accidents have occurred in small and medium enterprises 
      (SMEs). Efforts in reducing accidents have been undertaken through the 
      implementation of safety behaviors. Unfortunately, few studies have examined 
      motives behind unsafe behaviors, such as safety silence motives. This study aimed 
      to observe the motives underlying safety behaviors, namely safety silence motive 
      (SSM) (SSM-relation, SSM-climate, SSM-issue, and SSM-job) and to evaluate the 
      effect of SSM and safety communication on safety participation in different 
      industrial sectors and scales. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty workers from two 
      industrial sectors and scales of SMEs were involved. They were instructed to fill 
      out a set of questionnaires. A five-Likert scale was used to respond. An 
      independent t test was applied to find any significant differences. The partial 
      least square-structural equation modeling for multigroup was used to develop a 
      model on relations among the variables. RESULTS: The results showed that SSM 
      scores were high in SMEs, and the scores were different across industrial sectors 
      and scales. SSM had a negative influence on safety communication, and safety 
      communication positively influenced safety participation. CONCLUSION: The study 
      of SSM, safety communication, and safety participation in different sectors and 
      scales should be separated in SMEs.
