AB  - Lung granulomas are uncommon in Thailand. The disease typically develops from an 
      occupational environment and is mostly caused by infection. Herein is a case 
      report of a female patient, aged 48, working as a nurse in an Accident and 
      Emergency Department at a hospital. Eighteen years prior to admission the patient 
      was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis and pulmonary tuberculosis. The chest X-ray 
      and CT scans showed a solitary pulmonary nodule in the lower left lung. The 
      patient received an open thoracotomy with a left lobectomy. Granulomatous and 
      nonseptate hyphae were found in the pathology diagnosis. The patient was thus 
      diagnosed as having a lung granuloma. The galactomannan antigen test was 
      positive. The solitary pulmonary nodule-found from the use of a Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (PCR) test-was an Aspergillus spp. The fungus culture was collected from 
      air samples. The air samples were collected by the impaction technique using a 
      microbial air sampler. Three types of Aspergillus spp. were found as well as 
      Penicillium spp. and Monilia sitophila. The Aspergillus spp. was a match for the 
      patient's disease. The patient was diagnosed as having a lung granuloma possibly 
      Aspergillus nodule which was caused by airborne Aspergillus spp. from the 
      occupational environment.
