TI  - Synthesis of Evidence to Support EMS Personnel's Mental Health During Disease 
      Outbreaks: A Scoping Review.

AB  - Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are at high risk for adverse mental 
      health outcomes during disease outbreaks. To support the development of 
      evidence-informed mitigation strategies, we conducted a scoping review to 
      identify the extent of research pertaining to EMS personnel's mental health 
      during disease outbreaks and summarized key factors associated with mental health 
      outcomes. We systematically searched three databases for articles containing 
      keywords within three concepts: EMS personnel, disease outbreaks, and mental 
      health. We screened and retained original peer-reviewed articles that discussed, 
      in English, EMS personnel's mental health during disease outbreaks. Where 
      inferential statistics were reported, the associations between individual and 
      work-related factors and mental health outcomes were synthesized. Twenty-five 
      articles were eligible for data extraction. Our findings suggest that many of the 
      contributing factors for adverse mental health outcomes are related to 
      inadequacies in fulfilling EMS personnel's basic safety and informational needs. 
      In preparation for future disease outbreaks, resources should be prioritized 
      toward ensuring adequate provisions of personal protective equipment and 
      infection prevention and control training. This scoping review serves as a 
      launching pad for further research and intervention development.
