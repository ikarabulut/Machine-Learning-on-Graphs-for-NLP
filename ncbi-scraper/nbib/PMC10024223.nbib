TI  - Tailored Sun Safety Messages for Outdoor Workers.
PG  - 43-49
LID - 10.1016/j.shaw.2023.01.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Messaging surrounding skin cancer prevention has previously focused 
      on the general public and emphasized how or when activities should be undertaken 
      to reduce solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. Generic messages may not be 
      applicable to all settings, and should be tailored to protect unique and/or 
      highly susceptible subpopulations, such as outdoor workers. The primary objective 
      of this study was to develop a set of tailored, practical, harm-reducing sun 
      safety messages that will better support outdoor workers and their employers in 
      reducing the risk of solar UVR exposure and UVR-related occupational illnesses. 
      METHODS: We adapted a core set of sun safety messages previously developed for 
      the general population to be more applicable and actionable by outdoor workers 
      and their employers. This study used an integrated knowledge translation approach 
      and a modified Delphi method (which uses a survey-based consensus process) to 
      tailor the established set of sun safety messages for use for outdoor worker 
      populations. RESULTS: The tailored messages were created with a consideration for 
      what is feasible for outdoor workers, and provide users with key facts, 
      recommendations, and tips related to preventing skin cancer, eye damage, and heat 
      stress, specifically when working outdoors. CONCLUSION: The resulting tailored 
      messages are a set of evidence-based, expert- approved, and 
      stakeholder-workshopped messages that can be used in a variety of work settings 
      as part of an exposure control plan for employers with outdoor workers.
