AB  - BACKGROUND: The public now imposes higher demands on the government than in the 
      past, which has created the role overload faced by low-ranking government 
      employees in China. This research investigates the relationship between role 
      overload and health among low-ranking government employees and explores the 
      mediating effects of burnout. METHODS: It draws on a survey of 2064 low-ranking 
      government employees by probability proportionate to size sampling in China's 
      Shandong Province. Structural equation modeling (SEM) methods are used to analyze 
      the data. RESULTS: Both role overload and burnout were found to have negative 
      effects on low-ranking government employees' health; however, the associations 
      varied among the three age groups (less than 36, between 36 and 45, and over 45). 
      Those over 45 reported the highest level of both physical and psychological 
      health, while the youngest age group (less than 36) reported the lowest level of 
      health. Role overload has a direct influence on health among government employees 
      over 45 but not among those below 45. Burnout's mediating effects between role 
      overload and health are significant among all age groups, but most significant 
      among the youngest civil servants below 36. CONCLUSIONS: The findings evidenced 
      that both role overload and burnout affect low-ranking government employees' 
      self-reported physical and psychological health. In addition, the effect of age 
      differences in coping with role stressors and burnout should be considered.
