AB  - BACKGROUND: Coal mining is a hazardous industry. The purpose of the study is to 
      identify the nature of occupational injuries and diseases among coal miners and 
      to determine the factors that affect the rate of injury and duration of time loss 
      from work. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using accepted 
      workers' compensation claims data of 30,390 Australian coal miners between July 
      2003 and June 2017. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal and fracture conditions accounted 
      for approximately 60% of claims in all occupational groups. Cox regression 
      analysis showed that older age and female gender were significant predictors of 
      longer time off work. Injury types and occupations were associated with work time 
      loss: mental health conditions, and machine operators and drivers had 
      significantly longer durations of time off work. CONCLUSION: Future research can 
      further address how these factors led to longer time off work so that coal 
      industry regulators, employers, and healthcare providers can target interventions 
      more effectively to these at-risk workers.
