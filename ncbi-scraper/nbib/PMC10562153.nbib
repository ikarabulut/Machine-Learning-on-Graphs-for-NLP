AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat stress is a harmful physical hazard in many occupational 
      settings. However, consequences of occupational heat exposure among workers in a 
      sugarcane factory in Ethiopia are not well characterized. This study aimed to 
      assess the level of occupational heat exposure-related symptoms and contributing 
      factors. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, five workstations were selected 
      for temperature measurement. Heat stress levels were measured using a wet-bulb 
      globe temperature index meter. A stratified random sampling technique was used to 
      select 1,524 participants. Heat-related symptoms were assessed using validated 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: The level of occupational heat exposure was 72.4% (95% 
      CI: 70.2%-74.8%), while 71.6% (95% CI: 69.3%-74.9%) of participants experienced 
      at least one symptom related to heat stress. The most common heat-related 
      symptoms were swelling of hands and feet (78%), severe thirst (77.8%) and dry 
      mouth (77.4%). The identified risk factors were a lack of reflective shields 
      (AOR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.17), not-enclosed extreme heat sources (AOR: 1.76, 
      95% CI: 1.23, 2.51), a lack of access to shade (AOR: 9.62, 95% CI: 6.20, 14.92), 
      and inappropriate protective clothing provision (AOR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.71). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The burden of occupational heat exposure and heat-induced symptoms 
      was high. Lack of reflective shields, the absence of enclosed extreme heat 
      sources, a lack of access to shade, and inappropriate protective clothing 
      provision were considerable attributes of heat stress. Therefore, the use of 
      mechanical solutions to stop heat emissions at their sources and the key factors 
      identified were areas for future intervention.
