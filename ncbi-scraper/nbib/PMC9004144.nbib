TI  - Risk Factors for COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers. A First Report From 
      a Living Systematic Review and meta-Analysis.

AB  - Health care workers (HCWs) are more than ten times more likely to be infected 
      with coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) than the general population, 
      thus demonstrating the burden of COVID-19 among HCWs. Factors that expose HCWs to 
      a differentially high-risk of COVID-19 acquisition are important to elucidate, 
      enable appropriate public health interventions to mitigate against high risk and 
      reduce adverse outcomes from the infection. We conducted a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis to summarize and critically analyze the existing evidence on 
      SARS-CoV-2 risk factors among HCWs. With no geographical limitation, we included 
      studies, in any country, that reported (i) the PCR laboratory diagnosis of 
      COVID-19 as an independent variable (ii) one or more COVID-19 risk factors among 
      HCWs with risk estimates (relative risk, odds ratio, or hazard ratio) (iii) 
      original, quantitative study design, and published in English or Mandarian. Our 
      initial search resulted in 470 articles overall, however, only 10 studies met the 
      inclusion criteria for this review. Out of the 10 studies included in the review, 
      inadequate/lack of protective personal equipment, performing tracheal intubation, 
      and gender were the most common risk factors of COVID-19. Based on the random 
      effects adjusted pooled relative risk, HCWs who reported the use of protective 
      personal equipment were 29% (95% CI: 16% to 41%) less likely to test positive for 
      COVID-19. The study also revealed that HCWs who performed tracheal intubations 
      were 34% (95% CI: 14% to 57%) more likely to test positive for COVID-19. 
      Interestingly, this study showed that female HCWs are at 11% higher risk (RR 1.11 
      95% CI 1.01-1.21) of COVID-19 than their male counterparts. This article presents 
      initial findings from a living systematic review and meta-analysis, therefore, 
      did not yield many studies; however, it revealed a significant insight into 
      better understanding COVID-19 risk factors among HCWs; insights important for 
      devising preventive strategies that protect them from this infection. PROSPERO
