AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify work-related risk factors, including 
      long working hours and night/shift work, for unmet health care need using data of 
      a representative panel of Korean adults. METHODS: Associations between 
      work-related factors and unmet health care need were analyzed using data of 3,440 
      participants (10,320 observations) from the 2011-2013 Korean Health Panel Study. 
      A generalized estimating equation was used for the analysis of repeated measures. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of unmet health care was 16.6%. After adjusting sex, age, 
      socioeconomic status, work characteristics, and working more than 60 hours per 
      week (odds ratio [OR]: 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.65) or 50-59 
      hours per week (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46) instead of 40-49 hours per week and 
      night/shift work (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.06-1.51) were associated with unmet health 
      care need. CONCLUSION: Long working hours and night/shift work are risk factors 
      for unmet health care need among the Korean working population.
