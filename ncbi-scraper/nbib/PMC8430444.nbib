      Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone: A Hospital-Based Nine-Year Follow-up Retrospective 
      Cohort Study in Taiwan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-care providers typically undergo shift work and are subjected 
      to increased stress. Night shift work may induce disturbed sleep cycles and 
      circadian rhythm. The objective of this study was to explore if night shift 
      workers (NSWs) show an increased risk of abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone 
      (TSH). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 574 employees 
      without thyroid disease and abnormal TSH at baseline who underwent annual 
      check-ups between 2007 and 2016 in a medical center. NSWs were defined as those 
      with working time schedules other than daytime hours. We calculated the incidence 
      rate and estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident abnormal TSH and 
      subclinical hypothyroidism compared with non-NSWs using a Cox regression model. 
      RESULTS: A total of 56 incident abnormal TSH cases and 39 subclinical 
      hypothyroidism cases in NSWs were identified during 3000 person-years of 
      follow-up. In models adjusted for age, sex, obesity, and working departments, we 
      found no increased relative risk for incident abnormal TSH (HR: 0.72, 95% 
      confidence interval: 0.33-1.60) or subclinical hypothyroidism (HR: 0.52, 95% 
      confidence interval: 0.19-1.45) when comparing NSWs to non-NSWs; nor were 
      incidence rates significantly different among exclusively medical employees after 
      excluding administrative staff. CONCLUSION: In this hospital-based nine-year 
      follow-up retrospective cohort study, NSWs were not associated with increased 
      relative risk of incident abnormal TSH and subclinical hypothyroidism, in 
      contrast to previous cross-sectional studies.
