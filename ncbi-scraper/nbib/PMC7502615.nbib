      Loss: A Systematic Literature Review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent worker health conditions 
      worldwide. Although the effect of noise exposure on hearing is well researched, 
      other workplace exposures may account for significant hearing loss. The aim of 
      this review was to determine whether occupational hand-arm vibration exposure 
      through use of power or pneumatic tools, independent of noise exposure, is 
      associated with permanent hearing loss. Do workers suffer from hand-arm 
      vibration-induced hearing loss? METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles published in 
      English between 1981 and 2020 were identified through five online databases with 
      five search keywords. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-analyses guidelines, including online database search methodology, study 
      selection, article exclusion, and assessment of potential study design 
      confounders and biases, were followed. RESULTS: Database searches retrieved 697 
      articles. Fifteen articles that reported 17 studies met the criteria for review. 
      All but two studies revealed statistically significant associations between 
      occupational exposure to hand-arm vibration and hearing loss. The majority of the 
      study results revealed associations between hand-arm vibration and hearing loss, 
      independent of potential age and noise confounders. CONCLUSION: Few studies have 
      examined the association between occupational exposure to hand-arm vibration and 
      hearing loss. Dose response data were limited as only one study measured 
      vibration intensity and duration. Although the majority of studies identified 
      statistically significant associations, causal relationships could not be 
      determined. Further research using standardized and uniform measurement protocols 
      is needed to confirm whether the association between occupational exposure to 
      hand-arm vibration and permanent hearing loss is causal and the mechanism(s).
