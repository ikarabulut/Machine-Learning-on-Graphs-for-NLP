      Hybrid of HEART and Best-Worst Methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the important actions for enhancing human reliability in any 
      industry is assessing human error probability (HEP). The HEART technique is a 
      robust tool for calculating HEP in various industries. The traditional HEART has 
      some weaknesses due to expert judgment. For these reasons, a hybrid model is 
      presented in this study to integrate HEART with Best-Worst Method. MATERIALS 
      METHOD: In this study, the blasting process in an iron ore mine was investigated 
      as a case study. The proposed HEART-BWM was used to increase the sensitivity of 
      APOA calculation. Then the HEP was calculated using conventional HEART formula. A 
      consistency ratio was calculated using BWM. Finally, for verification of the 
      HEART-BWM, HEP calculation was done by traditional HEART and HEART-BWM. RESULTS: 
      In the view of determined HEPs, the results showed that the mean of HEP in the 
      blasting of the iron ore process was 2.57E-01. Checking the full blast of all the 
      holes after the blasting sub-task was the most dangerous task due to the highest 
      HEP value, and it was found 9.646E-01. On the other side, obtaining a permit to 
      receive and transport materials was the most reliable task, and the HEP was 
      8.54E-04. CONCLUSION: The results showed a good consistency for the proposed 
      technique. Comparing the two techniques confirmed that the BWM makes the 
      traditional HEART faster and more reliable by performing the basic comparisons.
