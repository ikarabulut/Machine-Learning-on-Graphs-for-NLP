TI  - Proposed Data-Driven Approach for Occupational Risk Management of Aircrew 
      Fatigue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is pervasive, under-reported, and potentially deadly where 
      flight operations are concerned. The aviation industry appears to lack a 
      standardized, practical, and easily replicable protocol for fatigue risk 
      assessment which can be consistently applied across operators. AIM: Our paper 
      sought to present a framework, supported by real-world data with subjective and 
      objective parameters, to monitor aircrew fatigue and performance, and to 
      determine the safe crew configuration for commercial airline operations. METHODS: 
      Our protocol identified risk factors for fatigue-induced performance degradation 
      as triggers for fatigue risk and performance assessment. Using both subjective 
      and objective measurements of sleep, fatigue, and performance in the form of 
      instruments such as the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Samn-Perelli Crew Status 
      Check, Psychomotor Vigilance Task, sleep logs, and a wearable actigraph for sleep 
      log correlation and sleep duration and quality charting, a workflow flagging 
      fatigue-prone flight operations for risk mitigation was developed and trialed. 
      RESULTS: In an operational study aimed at occupational assessment of fatigue and 
      performance in airline pilots on a three-men crew versus a four-men crew for a 
      long-haul flight, we affirmed the technical feasibility of our proposed framework 
      and approach, the validity of the battery of assessment instruments, and the 
      meaningful interpretation of fatigue and work performance indicators to enable 
      the formulation of safe work recommendations. CONCLUSION: A standardized 
      occupational assessment protocol like ours is useful to achieve consistency and 
      objectivity in the occupational assessment of fatigue and work performance.
