AB  - BACKGROUND: Underground mines have several hazards that could lead to serious 
      consequences if they come into effect. Acquiring, evaluating, and using the 
      real-time data from the atmospheric monitoring system and miner's positional 
      information is crucial in deciding the best course of action. METHODS: A 
      graphical user interface-based software is developed that uses an AutoCAD-based 
      mine map, real-time atmospheric monitoring system, and miners' positional 
      information to guide on the shortest route to mine exit and other locations 
      within the mine, including the refuge chamber. Several algorithms are implemented 
      to enhance the visualization of the program and guide the miners through the 
      shortest routes. The information relayed by the sensors and communicated by other 
      personnel are collected, evaluated, and used by the program in proposing the best 
      course of action. RESULTS: The program was evaluated using two case studies 
      involving rescue relating to elevated carbon monoxide levels and increased 
      temperature simulating fire scenarios. The program proposed the shortest path 
      from the miner's current location to the exit of the mine, nearest refuge 
      chamber, and the phone location. The real-time sensor information relayed by all 
      the sensors was collected in a comma-separated value file. CONCLUSION: This 
      program presents an important tool that aggregates information relayed by sensors 
      to propose the best rescue strategy. The visualization capability of the program 
      allows the operator to observe all the information on a screen and monitor the 
      rescue in real time. This program permits the incorporation of additional sensors 
      and algorithms to further customize the tool.
