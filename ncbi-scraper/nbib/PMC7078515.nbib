AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that the prevalence of obesity in Korea is 
      increasing over time, however it is not known how the trends among occupational 
      groups and sex differ in such increasing trends. This study was designed to 
      provide recent trends of obesity among workers in Korea and to identify whether 
      there were differences among occupational groups. METHODS: We used data from the 
      Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Phases I to VI 
      (1998-2015), to analyze trends in the prevalence of obesity in adult Korean 
      workers. Obesity was defined as a body mass index of 25 kg/m(2) or higher. 
      Occupations were classified into 3 groups: (a) nonmanual workers, (b) 
      service/sales workers, and (c) manual workers. RESULTS: During the period of the 
      Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Phases I to VI, the 
      prevalence of obesity in male workers increased in all occupations (31.1% to 
      39.5% in manual workers, 32.3% to 38.2% in service/sales workers, and 25.3% to 
      39.7% in manual workers). However, female workers did not show any particular 
      tendency toward obesity, except for a significant decrease in the prevalence rate 
      in service/sales workers (30.8% to 23.9%, p for trend = 0.0048). CONCLUSION: The 
      trends of obesity prevalence by sex and occupation were different. For male 
      manual workers, the prevalence rate increased steadily during the data period, 
      while it decreased steadily in female sales/service workers.
