AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 poses an occupational health risk to health-care 
      workers. Several thousand health-care workers have already been infected, mainly 
      in China. Preventing intra-hospital transmission of the communicable disease is 
      therefore a priority. Based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient 
      Safety model, the strategies and measures to protect health-care workers in an 
      acute tertiary hospital are described along the domains of work task, 
      technologies and tools, work environmental factors, and organizational 
      conditions. The principle of zero occupational infection remains an achievable 
      goal that all health-care systems need to strive for in the face of a potential 
      pandemic.
