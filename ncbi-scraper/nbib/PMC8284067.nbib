AB  - INTRODUCTION: The risk of experiencing psychiatric symptoms related to the 
      COVID-19 pandemic is high among healthcare workers whose occupations are in 
      public health, emergency medicine, and intensive or critical care. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of fear of 
      COVID-19 among 411 frontline Egyptian physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
      identify determinants and predictors for fear of COVID-19; determine the impact 
      of fear of COVID-19 on job satisfaction; and detect the impact of fear of 
      COVID-19 on turnover intention. Three standardized scales (fear of COVID-19, job 
      satisfaction, and turnover intention scores) were used for data collection via 
      online Google Form. RESULTS: Regarding fear relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      16.5% of the study subjects were classified as experiencing a severe fear level, 
      while 78.1% experienced a moderate degree. A significant association between the 
      level of fear relating to COVID-19 and the work department. The highest degree of 
      fear is in a general-educational-university facility. Regarding job satisfaction, 
      42% of those having a severe level of fear are dissatisfied. Fear of COVID-19 is 
      negatively associated with job satisfaction while positively significant 
      correlated with turnover scores, a positive significant predictor of turnover 
      intention. Job satisfaction is negatively associated with turnover intention; a 
      negative significant predictor of turnover intention. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline 
      Egyptian physicians reported higher levels of fear relating to the COVID-19 
      pandemic (moderate to severe). Increased fear levels relating to COVID-19 have a 
      relationship with lower levels of job satisfaction and higher levels of job 
      turnover.
