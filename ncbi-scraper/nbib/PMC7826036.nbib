AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is a newly emerging infectious disease 
      worldwide, can be categorized as an occupational disease, because employees, 
      particularly in the healthcare system, can be infected at the workplace. As of 
      December 15, 2020, we summarized the occupational safety and health practices in 
      selected countries on the recognition of COVID-19 as one of the occupational 
      risks. The situation has differed among countries, including the recognition 
      status and whether a specific regulation existed. International organizations, 
      namely the International Labour Organization, World Health Organization, and 
      European Union, should plan and conduct studies on the work-relatedness of 
      COVID-19, propose criteria for recognition, and add the infection to the 
      occupational disease list to provide a basis for specific country regulations. 
      Stakeholders should also act to adjust country-level legislation.
