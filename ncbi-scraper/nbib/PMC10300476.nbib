AB  - BACKGROUND: Job safety analysis (JSA) is a popular technique for hazard 
      identification and risk assessment in workplaces that has been applied across a 
      wide range of industries. This systematic review was conducted to answer four 
      main questions regarding JSA: (1) which sectors and areas have used JSA? (2) What 
      has been the aim of employing JSA? (3) What are the shortcomings of JSA? (4) What 
      are the new advances in the field of JSA? METHODS: Three main international 
      databases were searched: SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PubMed. After screening and 
      eligibility assessment, 49 articles were included. RESULTS: Construction 
      industries have used JSA the most, followed by process industries and healthcare 
      settings. Hazard identification is the main aim of JSA, but it has been used for 
      other purposes as well. Being time-consuming, the lack of an initial list of 
      hazards, the lack of a universal risk assessment method, ignoring hazards from 
      the surrounding activities, ambiguities regarding the team implementing JSA, and 
      ignorance of the hierarchy of controls were the main shortcomings of JSA based on 
      previous studies. CONCLUSION: In recent years, there have been interesting 
      advances in JSA making attempts to solve shortcomings of the technique. A 
      seven-step JSA was recommended to cover most shortcomings reported by studies.
