AB  - BACKGROUND: On the basis of its role for the development of occupational health 
      research, information, good practices, the International Commission on 
      Occupational Health (ICOH) launched the present survey to collect information on 
      public health and prevention policies put in place by the governments of the 
      countries in the world to contain the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study 
      was conducted through an online questionnaire focused on COVID-19 data, public 
      health policies, prevention measures, support measures for economy, work, and 
      education, personal protective equipment, intensive care units, contact tracing, 
      return to work, and the role of ICOH against COVID-19. The questionnaire was 
      administered to 113 ICOH National Secretaries and senior OSH experts. Collected 
      data refer to the period ranging from the beginning of the pandemic in each 
      country to June 30, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 73 questionnaires from 73 countries 
      around the world were considered valid, with a 64.6% response rate. Most of the 
      respondents (71.2%) reported that the state of emergency was declared in their 
      country, and 86.1% reported lockdown measures. Most of the respondents (66.7%) 
      affirmed that the use of face masks was compulsory in their country. As for 
      containment measures, 97.2% indicated that mass gatherings (meetings) were 
      limited. Regarding workplace closing, the most affected sector was entertainment 
      (90.1%). CONCLUSION: The results of this survey are useful to gain a global view 
      on COVID-19 policy responses at country level.
