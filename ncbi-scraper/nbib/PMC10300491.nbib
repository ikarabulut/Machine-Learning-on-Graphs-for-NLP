TI  - Firefighting and Cancer: A Meta-analysis of Cohort Studies in the Context of 
      Cancer Hazard Identification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis of epidemiological results for the 
      association between occupational exposure as a firefighter and cancer as part of 
      the broader evidence synthesis work of the IARCMonographs program. METHODS: A 
      systematic literature search was conducted to identify cohort studies of 
      firefighters followed for cancer incidence and mortality. Studies were evaluated 
      for the influence of key biases on results. Random-effects meta-analysis models 
      were used to estimate the association between ever-employment and duration of 
      employment as a firefighter and risk of 12 selected cancers. The impact of bias 
      was explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Among the 16 included cancer 
      incidence studies, the estimated meta-rate ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      and heterogeneity statistic (I(2)) for ever-employment as a career firefighter 
      compared mostly to general populations were 1.58 (1.14-2.20, 8%) for 
      mesothelioma, 1.16 (1.08-1.26, 0%) for bladder cancer, 1.21 (1.12-1.32, 81%) for 
      prostate cancer, 1.37 (1.03-1.82, 56%) for testicular cancer, 1.19 (1.07-1.32, 
      37%) for colon cancer, 1.36 (1.15-1.62, 83%) for melanoma, 1.12 (1.01-1.25, 0%) 
      for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1.28 (1.02-1.61, 40%) for thyroid cancer, and 1.09 
      (0.92-1.29, 55%) for kidney cancer. Ever-employment as a firefighter was not 
      positively associated with lung, nervous system, or stomach cancer. Results for 
      mesothelioma and bladder cancer exhibited low heterogeneity and were largely 
      robust across sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: There is epidemiological 
      evidence to support a causal relationship between occupational exposure as a 
      firefighter and certain cancers. Challenges persist in the body of evidence 
      related to the quality of exposure assessment, confounding, and medical 
      surveillance bias.
