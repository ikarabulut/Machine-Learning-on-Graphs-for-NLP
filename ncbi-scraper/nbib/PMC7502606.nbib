AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) poses an important occupational health risk 
      to health workers (HWs) that has attracted global scrutiny. To date, several 
      thousand HWs globally have been reported as infected with the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus that causes the disease. It is therefore 
      a public health priority for policymakers to understand risk factors for this 
      vulnerable group to avert occupational transmission. A rapid review was carried 
      out on 20 April 2020 on Covid-19 risk factors among HWs in PubMed, Google 
      Scholar, and EBSCOHost Web (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE 
      with Full Text, CINAHL with Full Text, APA PsycInfo, Health Source-Consumer 
      Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition) and WHO Global Database. We 
      also searched for preprints on the medRxiv database. We searched for reports, 
      reviews, and primary observational studies (case control, case cross-over, 
      cross-sectional, and cohort). The review included studies conducted among HWs 
      with Covid-19 that reported risk factors irrespective of their sample size. 
      Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Lack of personal protective equipment, 
      exposure to infected patients, work overload, poor infection control, and 
      preexisting medical conditions were identified as risk factors for Covid-19 among 
      HWs. In the context of Covid-19, HWs face an unprecedented occupational risk of 
      morbidity and mortality. There is need for rapid development of sustainable 
      measures that protect HWs from the pandemic.
