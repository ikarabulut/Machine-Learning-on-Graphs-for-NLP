TI  - Protective Measures From Solar Ultraviolet Radiation for Beach Lifeguards in 
      Tuscany (Italy): Shade and Clothing Strategies.
PG  - 421-428

AB  - BACKGROUND: The exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation is a significant risk 
      factor generally underestimated by outdoor workers and employers. Several studies 
      have pointed out that occupational solar exposure increased eye and skin diseases 
      with a considerable impact on the lives and productivity of affected workers.The 
      main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness against ultraviolet 
      radiation of some measures recently undertaken for the protection of lifeguards 
      in a coastal area of Tuscany. METHODS: Different shading structures (gazebos and 
      beach umbrella) were tested during a sunny summer's day on a sandy beach by means 
      of two radiometers; the UV protection offered by some T-shirts used by lifeguards 
      was also tested in the laboratory with a spectrophotometer. RESULTS: The analysed 
      shading structures strongly reduced the ultraviolet radiation by up to 90%, 
      however a not always negligible diffuse radiation is also present in the shade, 
      requiring further protective measures (T-shirt, sunglasses, sunscreen, etc.); the 
      tested T-shirts showed a very good-excellent protection according to the 
      Australian/New Zealand standard. CONCLUSION: Results obtained in this study 
      suggest how the adoption and dissemination of good practices, including those 
      tested, could be particularly effective as a primary prevention for lifeguards 
      who are subjected to very high levels of radiation for long periods.
