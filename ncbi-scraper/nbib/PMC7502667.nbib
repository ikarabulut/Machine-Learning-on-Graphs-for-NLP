AB  - BACKGROUND: Spontaneous combustion of coal is one of the factors which causes 
      direct or indirect gas and dust explosion, mine fire, the release of toxic gases, 
      loss of reserve, and loss of miners' life. To avoid these incidents, the 
      prediction of spontaneous combustion is essential. The safety of miner's in the 
      mining field can be assured if the prediction of a coal fire is carried out at an 
      early stage. METHOD: Adularya Underground Coal Mine which is fully mechanized 
      with longwall mining method was selected as a case study area. The data collected 
      for 2017, by sensors from ten gas monitoring stations were used for the 
      simulation and prediction of a coal fire. In this study, the fuzzy logic model is 
      used because of the uncertainties, nonlinearity, and imprecise variables in the 
      data. For coal fire prediction, CO, O(2), N(2), and temperature were used as 
      input variables whereas fire intensity was considered as the output variable.The 
      simulation of the model is carried out using the Mamdani inference system and run 
      by the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in MATLAB. RESULTS: The results showed that the fuzzy 
      logic system is more reliable in predicting fire intensity with respect to 
      uncertainties and nonlinearities of the data. It also indicates that the 1409 and 
      610/2B gas station points have a greater chance of causing spontaneous combustion 
      and therefore require a precautional measure. CONCLUSION: The fuzzy logic model 
      shows higher probability in predicting fire intensity with the simultaneous 
      application of many variables compared with Graham's index.
