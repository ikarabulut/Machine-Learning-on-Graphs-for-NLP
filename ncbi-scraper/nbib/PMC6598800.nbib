AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing workplace health-care perception has become a major issue 
      in the world. Most of the health-related problems are faced because of the lack 
      of health management instruments. The level of health care can be improved 
      through workplace health well-being regulations. The aim of the present study is 
      to formulate a conceptual model of physical checkup. METHODS: This study applied 
      conceptual theories and figures and used secondary data from articles and 
      relevant websites for evaluating the validity of the study. RESULTS: Annual 
      health checkup increases health-care awareness perception of states, 
      organizations, employees, and their families and manages the annual health record 
      of employees, organizations, and states. CONCLUSIONS: Health care and awareness 
      perception of states, organizations, employees, and families improves with annual 
      health checkup, and annual health checkup also prevents unhealthy acts.
