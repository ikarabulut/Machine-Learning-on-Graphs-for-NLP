      Budget-Industrial Accident Rate Model in Republic of Korea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the recent efforts to prevent industrial accidents in the 
      Republic of Korea, the industrial accident rate has not improved much. Industrial 
      safety policies and safety management are also known to be inefficient. This 
      study focused on dynamic characteristics of industrial safety systems and their 
      effects on safety performance in the Republic of Korea. Such dynamic 
      characteristics are particularly important for restructuring of the industrial 
      safety system. METHODS: The effects of damping and elastic characteristics of the 
      industrial safety system model on safety performance were examined and feedback 
      control performance was explained in view of cost and benefit. The implications 
      on safety policies of restructuring the industrial safety system were also 
      explored. RESULTS: A strong correlation between the safety budget and the 
      industrial accident rate enabled modeling of an industrial safety system with 
      these variables as the input and the output, respectively. A more effective and 
      efficient industrial safety system could be realized by having weaker elastic 
      characteristics and stronger damping characteristics in it. A substantial 
      decrease in total social cost is expected as the industrial safety system is 
      restructured accordingly. CONCLUSION: A simple feedback control with 
      proportional-integral action is effective in prevention of industrial accidents. 
      Securing a lower level of elastic industrial accident-driving energy appears to 
      have dominant effects on the control performance compared with the damping effort 
      to dissipate such energy. More attention needs to be directed towards physical 
      and social feedbacks that have prolonged cumulative effects. Suggestions for 
      further improvement of the safety system including physical and social feedbacks 
      are also made.
