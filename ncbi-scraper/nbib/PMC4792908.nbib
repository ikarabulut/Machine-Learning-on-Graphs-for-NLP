      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific 
      occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad 
      occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000-2009. METHODS: 
      Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and 
      comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was 
      based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding 
      for Intentional self-harm (X60-X84) was based on the international classification 
      of diseases (ICD-10). RESULTS: Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, 
      skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were 
      seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive 
      group of 30-39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50-59 
      age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated 
      number of suicide deaths. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed into the 
      work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and 
      focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working 
      age populations.
