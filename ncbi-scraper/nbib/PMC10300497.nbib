AB  - BACKGROUND: The reoccurrence of occupational accidents in Sudan is evidence of a 
      lack of effective Occupational Health and Safety (OSH) governance in Sudan. 
      METHODS: This scope review research articles on OSH governance in Sudan from 
      different sources, including international websites, official government 
      websites, original research articles in journals, and various reports. The five 
      stages of the scoping review followed in this study are: identifying the research 
      question; identifying relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; 
      collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. RESULTS: There is numerous 
      legislation in place; however, there is no evidence of their enforcement, and no 
      formal bodies at the national level are identified as being responsible for their 
      enforcement. CONCLUSION: Having multiple authorities with overlapping 
      responsibilities hinders OSH governance. An integrated governance model is 
      proposed to eliminate overlapping duties and to facilitate the participation of 
      all stakeholders in the governance process.
