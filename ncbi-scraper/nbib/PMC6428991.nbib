AB  - BACKGROUND: Promoting healthy lifestyles at work should complement workplace 
      safety programs. This study systematically investigates current states of 
      occupational health and safety (OHS) policy as well as practice in the European 
      Union (EU). METHODS: OHS policies of EU member states were categorized as either 
      prevention or health promotion provisions using a manifest content analysis. 
      Policy rankings were then created for each prevention and promotion. Rankings 
      compared eight indicators from the European Survey of Enterprises on New and 
      Emerging Risks-2 data on prevention and promotion practices for each member state 
      using Chi-square and probit regression analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 73.1% of EU 
      establishments take preventive measures against direct physical harm, and about 
      35.4% take measures to prevent psychosocial risks. Merely 29.5% have measures to 
      promote health. Weak and inconsistent links between OHS policy and practice 
      indicators were identified. CONCLUSION: National OHS policies evidently 
      concentrate on prevention while compliance with health and safety practices is 
      relatively low. Psychosocial risks are often addressed in national policy but not 
      implemented by institutions. Current risk assessment methods are outdatedÂ and 
      often lack psychosocial indicators. Health promotion at work is rare in policy 
      and practice, and its interpretation remains preventive. Member states need to 
      adopt policies that actively improve health and well-being at the workplace.
