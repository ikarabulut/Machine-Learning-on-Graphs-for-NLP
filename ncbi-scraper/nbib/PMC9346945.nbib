TI  - Comparisons of Core Temperature Between a Telemetric Pill and Heart Rate 
      Estimated Core Temperature in Firefighters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Firefighters may experience high environmental temperatures or carry 
      out intensive physical tasks, or both, which leads to increased core body 
      temperature and risk of fatalities. Hence there is a need to remotely and 
      non-invasively monitor core body temperature. METHODS: Estimated (heart rate 
      algorithm) and actual core body temperature (ingested telemetric pill) measures 
      were collected simultaneously for comparison during training exercises on 44 
      firefighter volunteers. RESULTS: Prediction of core body temperature varied, with 
      no specific identifiable pattern between the algorithm values and directly 
      measured body core temperatures. Group agreement of Lin's Concordance of 0.74 
      (95% Upper 0.75, lower CI 0.73), was deemed poor. CONCLUSION: From individual 
      agreement data Lin's Concordance was variable (Min 0.11, CI 0.13-0.01; Max 0.83, 
      CI 0.86-0.80), indicating that the heart rate algorithm approach was not suitable 
      for core body temperature monitoring in this population group, especially at the 
      higher more critical core body temperatures seen.
