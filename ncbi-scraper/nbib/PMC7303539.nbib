TI  - Resilience Engineering Indicators and Safety Management: A Systematic Review.

AB  - A safe work environment is crucial in high-risk industries, such as construction 
      refurbishment. Safety incidents caused by uncertainty and unexpected events in 
      construction refurbishment systems are difficult to control using conventional 
      safety management techniques. Resilience engineering (RE) is proposed as an 
      alternative to traditional safety management approaches. It presents a successful 
      safety management methodology designed to deal with uncertainty in high-risk work 
      environments. Despite the fact that RE resides in the safety domain, there is no 
      common set of RE indicators to measure and assess resilient in the work 
      environment. The main aim of this research is to explore RE indicators that have 
      been identified as important in developing and assessing the resilient work 
      environment in high-risk industries, particularly in construction refurbishment. 
      Indicators have been attained through a systematic literature review of research 
      and scholarly articles published between the years 2004 and 2019. The literature 
      review explored RE indicators in various industries. Descriptive analysis and 
      co-occurrence-based network visualization were used for data analysis. The 
      findings revealed 28 RE indicators in 11 different high-risk industries. The 
      results show that the four commonly used indicators were: top-management 
      commitment, awareness, learning, and flexibility, all of which have a strong 
      relationship with RE. The findings of this study are useful for stakeholders when 
      making decisions concerning the most important RE indicators in the context of 
      their research or practice as this would avoid the ambiguity and disparity in the 
      identification of RE indicators.
