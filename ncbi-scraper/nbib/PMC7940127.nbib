AB  - This review article addresses the role of safety professionals in the diffusion 
      strategies for predictive analytics for safety performance. The article explores 
      the models, definitions, roles, and relationships of safety professionals in 
      knowledge application, access, management, and leadership in safety analytics. 
      The article addresses challenges safety professionals face when integrating 
      safety analytics in organizational settings in four operations areas: 
      application, technology, management, and strategy. A review of existing 
      conventional safety data sources (safety data, internal data, external data, and 
      context data) is briefly summarized as a baseline. For each of these data 
      sources, the article points out how emerging analytic data sources (such as 
      Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things) broaden and challenge the scope of work 
      and operational roles throughout an organization. In doing so, the article 
      defines four perspectives on the integration of predictive analytics into 
      organizational safety practice: the programmatic perspective, the technological 
      perspective, the sociocultural perspective, and knowledge-organization 
      perspective. The article posits a four-level, organizational 
      knowledge-skills-abilities matrix for analytics integration, indicating key 
      organizational capacities needed for each area. The work shows the benefits of 
      organizational alignment, clear stakeholder categorization, and the ability to 
      predict future safety performance.
