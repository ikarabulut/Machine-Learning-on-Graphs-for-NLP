AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored personal protective equipment (PPE) availability 
      and PPE utilization among interventionalists in the catheterization laboratory, 
      which is a highly contextualized workplace. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional 
      study using mixed methods. Participants (108) completed a survey. A hyperlink was 
      sent to the participants, or they were asked to complete a paper-based survey. 
      Purposively selected participants (54) were selected for individual (30) or group 
      (six) interviews. The interviews were conducted at conferences, or appointments 
      were made to see the participants. Logistic regression analysis was performed. 
      The qualitative data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Lead glasses were 
      consistently used 10.2% and never used 61.1% of the time. All forms of PPE were 
      inconsistently used by 92.6% of participants. Women were 4.3 times more likely to 
      report that PPE was not available. PPE compliance was related to fit and 
      availability. CONCLUSIONS: PPE use was inconsistent and not always available. 
      Improving the culture of radiation protection in catheterization laboratories is 
      essential to improve PPE compliance with the aim of protecting patients and 
      operators. This culture of radiation protection must include all those involved 
      including the users of PPE and the administrators and managers who are 
      responsible for supplying sufficient, appropriate, fitting PPE for all workers 
      requiring such protection.
