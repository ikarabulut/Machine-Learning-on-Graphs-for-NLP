AB  - BACKGROUND: Nursing service is a nonroutine work with an excessive physical load 
      and diverse tasks. This study derived representative common tasks based on the 
      frequently occurring tasks with a high physical load in the nursing workers' 
      daily work and developed indicators to evaluate the work risk by reflecting the 
      characteristics of nonroutine work. METHODS: Common tasks were classified through 
      the following stages: literature review, first focus group interview (FGI) with 
      experts, first classification of common tasks, second FGI with hospital health 
      managers, a survey of nursing service workers, and the final classification of 
      common tasks for each task type. To develop an objective risk index for physical 
      load assessment, we investigated the frequency and duration of the derived common 
      tasks via survey. RESULTS: Nursing common tasks were categorized into six task 
      types and 56 subtasks. To evaluate the risks of various tasks in nonroutine 
      works, three frequencies and three working time levels were defined by examining 
      the task frequency and working hours. Exposure time was defined to reflect the 
      characteristics of a nonroutine job. The final risk assessment was the product of 
      the exposure time level and job intensity level. From this, four risk action 
      levels were derived. CONCLUSION: This study has the advantage of solving the 
      problem of focusing on some tasks in evaluating the physical load. It was 
      meaningful in that a new risk assessment index based on exposure time was 
      proposed based on the development of an evaluation scale for frequency and time 
      by reflecting the characteristics of nonroutine work.
